# Hotel-Reservation-system
Existing systems: 
 Manual Bookings: Many hotels still rely on phone calls, emails, or even in-person requests for 
reservations, which can be time-consuming. 
 Paperwork and Spreadsheets: Hotels often manage their bookings, customer details, and payments 
using paperwork or simple spreadsheet software, which increases the risk of errors. 
 Lack of Real-Time Availability: Customers may not get up-to-date information on room availability, 
which can lead to overbooking or loss of potential customers.

    Manual Data Entry: Many systems require manual entry of bookings, which can lead to human errors.
